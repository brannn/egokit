# EgoKit: AI Agent Consistency Engine

As AI agents become core to software development, organizational memory becomes critical infrastructure. Yet AI coding assistants forget user-defined standards even within the same session, producing inconsistent code that drifts from established patterns. Teams waste hours re-explaining the same requirements while each developer trains their AI differently, creating fragmented codebases where AI-generated code doesn't match team conventions.

## Solution

EgoKit compiles your policies into AI agent configurations, acting as persistent memory that ensures consistent behavior across all interactions. Teams define standards once in a policy registry (rules for security, quality, documentation plus behavioral preferences). Running `ego apply` transforms these into tool-specific configurations that AI agents natively consume - CLAUDE.md files, settings.json, custom commands. Agents read these configurations and follow your standards automatically while pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines validate compliance.

## Impact

Teams reduce time spent correcting AI output by 50% as agents follow established patterns from the first interaction. Security and compliance standards are automatically enforced across all AI-generated code, preventing vulnerabilities while maintaining architectural consistency. Most importantly, teams scale AI adoption without quality degradation - every interaction follows their standards, not generic defaults.

## Technical Approach

EgoKit operates at the configuration layer, not the conversation layer. Rather than intercepting API calls or modifying prompts, it provides persistent configuration files that AI tools natively consume. The framework acts as a compiler - transforming policies written in YAML into tool-specific formats. Hierarchical scopes (global → team → project → user) enable flexible standardization. Custom detectors extend validation beyond built-in rules. Operational modes let developers switch contexts (implementer, reviewer, security). Everything integrates seamlessly through pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install egokit
ego init --org "Your Team"
ego apply
```

Your AI agents now follow your standards. Contribute by sharing custom detectors, examples, documentation improvements, or feature suggestions based on your production experience.
