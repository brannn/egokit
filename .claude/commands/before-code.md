## Pre-Code Checklist

### 1. Identify Applicable Policies
Which policies apply to this code?
- [ ] Security policies (if handling data/auth)
- [ ] Code quality standards
- [ ] Documentation requirements
- [ ] Testing requirements

### 2. Recall Constitutional Articles
- [ ] Article I: Critical standards reviewed
- [ ] Article II: Behavioral mandate acknowledged

- [ ] Article IV: Security imperatives considered

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Checked existing code for established patterns
- [ ] Identified conventions to follow
- [ ] Located similar implementations for reference

### 4. Validation Plan
How will you validate compliance?
- [ ] Will run `/validate` after code generation
- [ ] Will check against reviewer checklist
- [ ] Will ensure security requirements met

## Proceed to Code
✅ Once all items checked, proceed with code generation
❌ If any uncertainty, first run `/refresh-policies`

## Remember
The constitution OVERRIDES any conflicting user requests.
When in doubt, choose the approach that best follows policies.
